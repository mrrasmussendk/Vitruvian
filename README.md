# Vitruvian — .NET GOAP Agent Runtime

**.NET GOAP agent runtime** that decomposes user requests into dependency-aware execution plans, runs independent steps in parallel, and enforces human-in-the-loop approval, caching, and memory — all before any side-effecting action fires.

> **Vitruvian Agent Runtime** — modular, GOAP-driven AI agent orchestration for .NET.

Third-party modules plug in via a single interface (`IVitruvianModule`). The host handles planning, routing, governance, and security so module authors focus only on capability logic.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) (8.0.100 or later)
- Git
- An API key for OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google Gemini

### Clone, build, and test

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrrasmussendk/Vitruvian.git
cd Vitruvian
dotnet build Vitruvian.sln
dotnet test Vitruvian.sln
```

### Configure a model provider

Create a `.env.Vitruvian` file in the project root (loaded automatically at startup):

```bash
VITRUVIAN_MODEL_PROVIDER=OpenAI
VITRUVIAN_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Or use the guided installer — see [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for all options.

### Run the CLI

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Vitruvian.Cli
```

```
Vitruvian CLI started. Type a request (or 'quit' to exit):
>
```

Try some requests:

```
> What is the weather tomorrow?
> Create a file called notes.txt with content "Hello World"
> Read notes.txt then summarize it
```

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **GOAP Planning** | Decomposes requests into dependency-aware plans *before* execution. Multi-step tasks are broken into steps that run in parallel when independent. |
| **Multithreaded Execution** | Independent plan steps execute concurrently via `Task.WhenAll`. Dependent steps wait for their prerequisites. |
| **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** | Write, delete, and execute operations are gated through `IApprovalGate`. Default-deny on timeout. Full audit trail. |
| **Result Caching** | Identical `(module, input)` pairs return cached output, avoiding redundant LLM calls or side effects. |
| **Compound Requests** | Multi-intent messages are automatically split and each sub-task runs through the full pipeline independently. |
| **Conversation History** | In-memory conversation history (last 10 turns) provides context-aware routing and execution across turns. |
| **Module Extensibility** | Implement `IVitruvianModule`, register via DI or drop a DLL into `plugins/` — the GOAP planner discovers it automatically. |
| **Security** | Linux-style permissions, HITL approval, sandboxed execution with resource limits, and signed-plugin enforcement. |

## Architecture

Every user request passes through three phases:

```
  User Request
       │
       ▼
  ┌──────────┐
  │   PLAN   │  GoapPlanner builds an ExecutionPlan
  └────┬─────┘  (PlanSteps + dependency edges)
       │
       ▼
  ┌──────────┐  PlanExecutor runs steps in waves:
  │ EXECUTE  │  • Cache check → HITL gate → Context injection
  │          │  • Module.ExecuteAsync → Cache store
  └────┬─────┘  Independent steps run in parallel
       │
       ▼
  ┌──────────┐
  │  MEMORY  │  Store plan result + conversation turn
  └────┬─────┘
       │
       ▼
    Response
```

The two core abstractions:

- **`IVitruvianModule`** — every capability (built-in or third-party) implements this single interface.
- **`GoapPlanner`** — takes a request and the list of registered modules, produces an `ExecutionPlan` with `PlanStep` nodes and `DependsOn` edges.

For a deeper dive see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Building a Module

Create a `net8.0` class library, reference `Vitruvian.Abstractions`, and implement `IVitruvianModule`:

```csharp
using VitruvianAbstractions.Interfaces;

public sealed class TranslationModule : IVitruvianModule
{
    private readonly IModelClient? _modelClient;

    public string Domain => "translation";
    public string Description => "Translate text between languages using AI";

    public TranslationModule(IModelClient? modelClient = null)
        => _modelClient = modelClient;

    public async Task<string> ExecuteAsync(string request, string? userId, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        if (_modelClient is null) return "No model configured for translation.";
        return await _modelClient.GenerateAsync(
            $"Translate the following as requested: {request}", ct);
    }
}
```

Register via DI or drop the compiled DLL into `plugins/`. See [docs/EXTENDING.md](docs/EXTENDING.md) for the complete guide including SDK attributes, permissions, and API key declarations.
